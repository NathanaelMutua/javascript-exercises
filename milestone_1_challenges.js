// Write a function called greetUser(name, hour) that returns a personalized greeting based on the hour of the day.
// The name is a string representing the user's name.
// The hour is a number from 0 to 23, representing the current hour in 24-hour format.
// Return a greeting like:
// "Good morning, Alice!" if the hour is between 5 and 11
// "Good afternoon, Alice!" if the hour is between 12 and 17
// "Good evening, Alice!" if the hour is between 18 and 21
// "Good night, Alice!" if the hour is 22–4



// Challenge 9: FizzBuzz
// Write a function called fizzBuzzCheck(number) that takes a number and returns:
// "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
